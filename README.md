# Hi there, I'm Abu Jafar Md. Salah 👋

**Senior Web Architect | PHP Specialist | System Designer**

With over 15 years in the trenches, I transform complex business requirements into high-performance digital reality. I specialize in the **PHP ecosystem**, modern **JavaScript frameworks**, and the **Linux** environments that power them.

I don’t just write code; I architect sustainable, secure foundations for SaaS, legacy migrations, and greenfield enterprise applications.

## 🚀 Featured Project: [TJDocRx](https://www.nsbd.net/tjdocrx-eprescription-software)

[**TJDocRx**](https://www.nsbd.net/tjdocrx-eprescription-software) is a sophisticated, full-stack medical ecosystem designed for hospitals and private practices. It exemplifies my approach to building "sustainable foundations."

* **Architecture:** Built with a robust **Laravel** backend and a high-performance **React** frontend.
* **Core Features:** Multi-doctor appointment scheduling, comprehensive e-Prescription engine, and dynamic Drag-and-Drop (DnD) page/menu builders.
* **Impact:** A "zero-coding required" deployment model that allows medical facilities to launch professional patient management systems instantly.
* **Scale:** Engineered for unlimited patients, doctors, and appointments with optimized MySQL indexing.
